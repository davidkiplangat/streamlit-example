,Internet_of_things,iot engineer,"The course was good, but what disappointed me was that the assignments were more focused on java script and less IoT. Also the lectures were short and fast at times, the instructor would move thru the demos so quick or show pages and not provide a detail description of what we were looking at, making things very confusing. At times for example I would look at the screen he was showing on the services running or docs and I was like where do I find this in BlueMix and what does all these nodes, services, etc.. mean? None of that was explained and if they were it was at a very high level. The assignments were not honest with the time estimates. Not sure about the others but I must have spent countless hours and nights working on these with little guidance or direction which would have saved me countless of wasted hours. The forums were not monitored frequently, and when I got responses they were late as by that time I figured my issues or some of the suggestions offered were cryptic not giving me any hints or letting me know if my approach was in the right direction.Either way, this course is very hard to do while also working on a full time job and travelling. With those aspects I hope that the forums are monitored by the instructors for a quick feedback loop and the lectures are updated to be more detailed. The only way I was able to finish this was because I worked 8+ hours each day and late night, and all weekends trying to make sure I finish by the end deadline (the last thing I wanted was this being monkey on my back for the next few more weeks).The positive is that I learned about BlueMix offerings and lastly I can play around now with the Raspberry Pi and do some real IoT and less Java scripting.",3,2017,"IoT Cloud Platform, Edge Computing, Mobile IoT Bluetooth Low Energy,  IoT Protocol, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), Quality of Service, Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence, JavaScript and Python, Knowledge about how sensors work, UI-centric Approach, Node.js Development, Big Data, Security, GPS systems, Cloud Computing, Mobile Hardware environment",4,1

,Internet_of_things,iot engineer,"Hi, I am an IT specialist (30 years experience). I undertook the course so I could learn about IBM Bluemix and IoT development, and extend my skills/understanding of the environment. However, I have very little good to say about this course offering. I had numerous issues with what was offered:The videos were generally ok, but some had poor audio. There was minimal video (compared to any other course I have done), and more detail and discussion in videos would have been more helpful.Some of the video material is out of date already, as I suspect Bluemix layout has changed - this made navigation a bit confusing.The downloadable Pi image has changed since the course was prepared, and the newer image has different code as standard. I ended up having to muddle-through manually loading packages and dependencies, etc. to get things to work.I lost many hours trying to debug and rework assignment code, just to get it to work for the grader tool. This was further complicated by not having good debug output from the grader to work with. Naturally some of the grader fails were my own fault, but the majority of issues I ran in to could have been avoided by better worded assignments and/or more detail about requirements.Lastly, it was taking sometimes days to get any response to requests for guidance on the forums / discussions. In fact, I think the majority of useful assistance came from other students who had run in to the same issue(s). When you have a course that is such a short time frame, you really need to be providing assistance in a timely manner.I could not, in any good faith, recommend anyone take this course in the future - which is a little saddening.

It looks easy but the lecturer didn't make it clear what it was for anyway.A much more thorough introduction should have been given to everything.The lectures on the Rasberry Pi were a joke. In order to do the course within 4 weeks I would have had to order a Rasberry Pi before getting to these lectures.
